# DataQuest-Mini-Projects
10 Different Guided Projects inspired from the [Dataquest Community](https://community.dataquest.io/)

-  Analysis of the traffic volume on the Interstate Highway 94. I searched via correlation analysis and graphical crossplotting for indicators to predict heavy traffic.
The complete code details with insights and conclusions is in Finding_heavy_traffic_indicators_I_94.ipynb

-  Answering Business Questions Using SQL.I have analyzed a modified version of the Chinook database for finding the answers to our business questions using SQL.The Chinook database represents a fictional digital media shop, based on real data from an iTunes Library and manually generated data. The Detialed analysis using SQL is in the notebook Answering_Business_Questions_using_SQL.ipynb

- Exploring Popular Data Science Questions.I explored the database of Data Science Stack Exchange, with the goal to figure out the most popular data science questions, and, consequently, the best content for a data science learning resource.The code notebook is Popular_Data_Science_Questions.ipynb

- Analysis on online mattress companies and specifically the customer feedback on the companies.Scraped data from trustpilot using BeuatifulSoup.The complete notebook with conclusions and steps is present in Mattress_customer_feedback.ipynb.

- Exploring Hacker News Posts. The main purpose is to determine if the data analysis results will provide best time of day to post questions where I would expect the highest frequency of comments/responses.The code notebook is in Hacker_News_Project.ipynb

- Exploring eBay Used Car Sales Data.The goals are to determine which are the main brands,find the most common brand/model combinations and determine if average prices follow any pattern based on mileage.The code notebook with conclusions is in Exploring_eBay_Car_Sales_Data.ipynb.

- Predicting Bike Rentals.The goal of this project is to predict dispersion total number of rented bikes by hour using different scikit-learn regression algorithms.The code notebook is in Predicting_Bike_Rental.ipynb

- Predicting the stock market - Using historical data on the price of the S&P500 Index to make predictions about future prices. The code notebook is in Predicting_the_stock_market.ipynb

- Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL -  Analyze data from the CIA World Factbook (2015), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The code notebook is in Analyzing_CIA_Factbook_Data_Using_SQL.ipynb

- Profitable App Profiles for the App Store and Google Play Markets - analyze data for a company that creates mobile applications for Android and iOS.The goal in this project is to analyze the data to help developers understand what kind of apps can attract more users.The code notebook is in Profitable_App_Profiles_for_the_App_Store_and_Google_Play_Markets.ipynb
